      <p class="color bold">Emmaus is named after a famous event on the day Jesus rose from the dead.</p>
<p class="color bold">Read the Story:  Luke 24:13-35</p>
<p class="color bold">On the Road to Emmaus</p>
<p class="color"><b>13</b> That very day two of them were going to a village named Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem, <b>14</b> and they were talking with each other about all these things that had happened. <b>15</b> While they were talking and discussing together, Jesus himself drew near and went with them. <b>16</b> But their eyes were kept from recognizing him. <b>17</b> And he said to them, “What is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk?” And they stood still, looking sad. <b>18</b> Then one of them, named Cleopas, answered him, “Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days?” <b>19</b> And he said to them, “What things?” And they said to him, “Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, a man who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people, <b>20</b> and how our chief priests and rulers delivered him up to be condemned to death, and crucified him. <b>21</b> But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel. Yes, and besides all this, it is now the third day since these things happened. <b>22</b> Moreover, some women of our company amazed us. They were at the tomb early in the morning, <b>23</b> and when they did not find his body, they came back saying that they had even seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive. <b>24</b> Some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but him they did not see.” <b>25</b> And he said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! <b>26</b> Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?” <b>27</b> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.</p>

<p class="color"><b>28</b> So they drew near to the village to which they were going. He acted as if he were going farther, <b>29</b> but they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, for it is toward evening and the day is now far spent.” So he went in to stay with them. <b>30</b> When he was at table with them, he took the bread and blessed and broke it and gave it to them. <b>31</b> And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And he vanished from their sight. <b>32</b> They said to each other, “Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?” <b>33</b> And they rose that same hour and returned to Jerusalem. And they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together, <b>34</b> saying, “The Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!”<b>35</b> Then they told what had happened on the road, and how he was known to them in the breaking of the bread.

<p class="color">EMMAUS ANGLICAN CHURCH was conceived in January of 2010, and first met for worship in Castle Rock on February first. The founders, including the priest, left an Episcopal church in the community. We sought liberty to share the life-changing message of Jesus. We found a home in the Anglican Church in North America.</p>
 
<p class="color">The congregation and its priest, Fr. Theron Walker were accepted into the Anglican Church of North America on Good Friday, 2010.  We joyfully adhere to and are blessed to be stewards of the faith once delivered to the saints.</p>
 
<p class="color">From the beginning, we have prayerfully sought to build a culture where people are truly welcomed: an open place of worship, liberty and learning. To us, the Anglican tradition is supposed to be alive. We are serious, and love to laugh. We aim for beauty in music, furnishings, language, but it must be home grown. We strive to serve God in the community, especially those Jesus called “the least of these.” We love to bring the key moments of the Bible to life, <i>dramatically</i>. We believe its important for all ages to pray, serve, and even play together, so Emmaus is a community where the older members reach out to the young, and the young keep the old learning.</p> 

<p class="color">August 25th, 2013 marked our first Sunday at our new home on Ridge Road.  After three and half years in rented spaces, Sunday only spaces, its so very, very good to have a home this side of eternity!  </p>
